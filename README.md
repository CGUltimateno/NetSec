## About The Project

This project is our third-year final technical project, developed as part of our coursework. It is a web application designed to reinforce the implementation of security measures, particularly in user authentication and registration processes. Security features such as JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication and password hashing using AES encryption were implemented to ensure robust protection of user credentials. Upon successful login, the system distinguishes between regular users and administrators, granting access to different functionalities based on their roles. This project served as a practical exercise in enhancing security practices within web applications.
